Tables = define the data
AppDatabase = connects everything
DAOs = perform database queries
Repositories = provide nice high-level functions
UI = calls the repositories


Process
1. Create tables to hold data in the tables.dart file
2. adjust appdatabase to connect based on the new tables
3. update DAOs to perform database queries on new table
4. Update high-level funcs in Repositories
5. Run the command in terminal:
flutter pub run build_runner build

also this command is used sometimes: 
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs


so that the correct database is built
